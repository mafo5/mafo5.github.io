    <h3 id="d34">Relevant legal bases</h3>
    <p>In the following, we share the legal basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), based on which we process the personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, the national data protection regulations may apply in your home or country of residence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Consent (Article 6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has consented to the processing of personal data relating to him for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Performance of the contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 (b) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract of which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures, at the request of the data subject respectively.</p>

    <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany</strong>: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the law on the protection against misuse of personal data in data processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special rules on the right of access, the right of cancellation, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular concerning the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states can be applied.</p>
    <h2 id="d4">Safety measures</h2>
    <p>We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the law, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, the different likelihoods of occurrence and the extent to which the rights and freedoms of individuals are threatened to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
    <p>Measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling the physical and electronic access to the data as well as their access, input, transfer, availability and segregation. We have also set up procedures to ensure the enjoyment of data subject rights, the erasure of data and responses to the threat to data. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already in the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures according to the principle of data protection, through technology design and privacy-friendly default settings.</p>

Data that has been disclosed to us as part of an order by the contractor, we delete according to the specifications of the contract, in principle after the end of the contract.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="d6">Provision of the online offer and web hosting</h2>
    <p>To provide our online offer safely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web-hosting providers whose servers (or servers managed by them) can access the online offer. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage and database services, as well as security and technical maintenance services.</p>
    <p>The data processed in the provision of the hosting offer may include all information relating to the use and communication of the users of our online offer. This includes, regularly, the IP address necessary to deliver the content of online content to browsers, and all submissions made within our online offer or web pages.</p>
    <p><strong>Content Delivery Network</strong>: We use a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN is a service that helps deliver content from an online offering, especially large media files, such as graphics or program scripts, faster and more securely using regionally distributed and Internet-connected servers..</p>
    <ul class="m-elements">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Processed data types:</strong> content data (eg text input, photographs, videos), usage data (eg visited websites, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (eg device information, IP addresses).</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="d7">Online marketing</h2>
    <p>We may process Personal Information for purposes of analyzing the use of our mobile apps, online services and other content (collectively referred to as "Content") based on potential user interest and measuring its effectiveness.</p>
    <p>For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar methods are used through which the information relevant to the presentation of the aforementioned contents to the user is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, web pages visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information, such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on the times of use. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, they can also be processed.</p>
    <p>It also stores the IP addresses of the users. However, we use available IP masking procedures (ie, pseudonymization by truncating the IP address) to protect users. In general, in the online marketing process, no clear data of the users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored, but pseudonyms. That is, we as well as the providers of online marketing methods do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.</p>
    <p>The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or similar procedures. These cookies can later generally also on other websites that use the same online marketing method, read and analyzed for purposes of displaying content as well as be supplemented with other data and stored on the server of the online marketing process provider.</p>
    <p>By way of exception, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case if, for example, the users are members of a social network whose online marketing process we use and the network connects the profiles of the users in the aforementioned information. We ask you to note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, eg by consent during the registration process.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is the consent. Otherwise, users' data will be processed based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>
    <ul class="m-elements">
